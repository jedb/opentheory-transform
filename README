Reads a proof trace in, converts it to a DAG a la ProofGraph, then converts it back into a linear proof trace.




Delete <input file> [<num#1>, <num#2>, <num3>]

Removes all theorems of specified numbers from a proof trace. Best used in conjunction with ListThm, so you can
actually know what theorems are what.




Concat <input #1> <input#2>




ListThm <input file>

Displays numbered theorems from a proof trace. Best used in conjunction with Delete so you know what theorems you
